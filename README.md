# Mini Projects Based on React.JS

I created a few small projects while learning React and its components. With these projects I was trying to implement the concept of various React components like *State, Props, Routers and Hooks.* 

### Airbnb clone
Here I tried to clone the Airbnb website with the implementation of React Props and some JSX

### Meme Generator
A basic meme generator using the State and Hooks components of React. Here I tried to implement passing states as props, conditional rendering and making API calls using useEffect() for fetching data.

### Generic Travel Website
Furthur implementation of react components like Props, and basic styling using vanilla CSS.
